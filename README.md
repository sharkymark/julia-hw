# Learning Julia

Julia is a dynamically-typed programming language designed for scientific computing, data science and ML. Although interpretive (with just-in-time compiling), it is very performant like C.

## dev container

I'm using a dev container so I don't have to install Julia on my Mac. All I need a is a Docker daemon, which in my case is `colima` and VS Code with the dev container extension.

## The app 

When learning a new language, I usually rewrite a simple app to calculate sales commissions. See `commissions.jl` in `/src`
